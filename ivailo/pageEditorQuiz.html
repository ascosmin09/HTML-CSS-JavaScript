The quiz is consisted of 10 questions each related to classical music.
The timer starts the moment the "Begin" button is pressed and
when the time is up it prompts you with an alert box that notifies you of it
and when you close it, it redirects you back to the start of the quiz.
After answering a question you'll be prompted with an alert box notifying you
if the answer is correfct or not. At the end of the quiz the background color changes to green if you scored
more than 0 points &#40;it can go down it -10 because with each wrong answer
points decrement with 1&#41; and for every correct one increment with 1.
There's also link that leads to the start of the quiz.
