<p>Link to Spotify added to text about Serenade No.13</p>
<p>Font Size changer added as required for Student 1 using JavaScript</p>


<p><b>
This page was done for Part B, which required us to create a profile,
or page describing a topic within our main topic. I chose Mozart, being
familiar with his music. The logo on the top left redirects the user
to the main page. I added information based on Mozart's life, as well as
arguably his most popular composition, Serenade No. 13. A link is put over the header
, taking the user to Serenade No.13 on Spotify, a music streaming platform. I did this
to promote streaming on paid platforms rather than free platforms such as YouTube.
The user is able to change the font size through the option buttons that I added using
JavaScript. This is required from Student 1, as seen on the specification.
