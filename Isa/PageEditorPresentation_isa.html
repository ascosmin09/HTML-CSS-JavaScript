This is a very simple page. This page displays the name of our website,
'Classical VM', in the font Papyrus, as this was our main font of choice
while developing our website. Under this, I have displayed the names
of all members in my group (4CSE-07-08_G3) in the font Sans-Serif.
Using a meta refresh, this page will direct to Student 2's page (main page)
