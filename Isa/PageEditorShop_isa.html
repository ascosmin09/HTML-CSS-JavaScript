I have created a merchandise shop consisting of 3 products; a shirt, hoodie
and a mug. The user will enter their desired quantities of each product,
their first and last names, as well as their emails.
Using JavaScript, I was able to take all fields of input
and compile them into 3 different alert messages. The first two give
the user the chance to cancel and get out of the order
confirmation. I have also added validation to ensure that all required
fields are filled out before the website is able to send the valid prompts
and alerts with all the information it requires. As well as this, I set the
minimum value on the product quantity input box to 0, to ensure that
the quantity number does not go into negative numbers, as it would cause
an error. As well as this, I used appropriate images for each product.
