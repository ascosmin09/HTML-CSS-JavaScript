	<p><b> This webpage is for Part B of the coursework. I decided to present Frédéric Chopin and a small part of his career. I presented 1 portrait image of him and a little life summary followed by 3 albums and their description. I guided myself after principals like similarity, using the same background color for elements from the same category; proximity, grouping elements that are related; closure and continuation. I also added an anchor(back to top) that appears only when the user scrolls down more than 20% of the lenght of the page and it changes the color while the mouse is hovering. I used CSS to keep the website in the colors pallet that we all agreed in the group.</b></p>
