    <h2>Completed tasks:</h2>
    form with javascript<br>
    required using javascript<br>
    Anchor<br>
    alert when form fully completed<br>
    No link to shop page, quiz, sitemap and extra pages because none were sent to me <br>
  <h5> Within this page I have made the form which will take the persons data and in an alert read back to the user what they have entered.
    additionally I have made it so that each field in the form is required, if the first name is missing then an alert will appear saying that
    this field is required/Please enter your name. i've repeated this process for the other fields as well. Additionally, ive added a few famous classical composers
    this being Mozart, Chopin and Beethoven with their pictures next to left of the text. I have also placed an anchor at the bottom of the page.</h5>
